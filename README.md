### What is Couchmove?

Couchmove is an open-source Java migration tool for [Couchbase](https://www.couchbase.com/), which is an NoSQL document-oriented database, well know for its performance and scalability.

Couchmove can help you *track*, *manage* and *apply changes* in your Couchbase buckets. The concept is very similar to other database migration tools such as [Liquibase](http://www.liquibase.org), [Flyway](http://flywaydb.org), [mongeez](https://github.com/secondmarket/mongeez), [mongobee](http://mongodb-tools.com/tool/mongobee/) ...

### What's special?

Couchmove is widely inspired from [Flyway](http://flywaydb.org) : it strongly favors simplicity and convention over configuration : There is *no XML configuration files*. Just **json documents**, **design documents** to import and **n1ql** files to execute.
